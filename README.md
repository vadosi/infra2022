Theory [2]
As usual, we will start with a few theoretical questions:

[0.5] What is Docker, and how it differs from dependencies management systems? From virtual machines?
[0.5] What are the advantages and disadvantages of using containers over other approaches?
[0.5] Explain how Docker works: what are Dockerfiles, how are containers created, and how are they run and destroyed?
[0.25] Name and describe at least one Docker competitor (i.e., a tool based on the same containerization technology).
[0.25] What is conda? How it differs from apt, yarn, and others?
